//   stdio-modern            stdio,  2026-07-28 era

//                                   NodeStreamableHTTPServerTransport branch — the

//   http-modern             HTTP,   2026-07-28 era (createMcpHandler-backed path)

// The era is chosen entirely by the client's `versionNegotiation`; the server's
// hybrid router / serveStdio decide the branch from the wire. Nothing in src is
// changed — the harness only chooses how each suite connects.

/**
 * Block until the legacy Streamable-HTTP server→client push channel is attached, so

 * racing the channel coming up.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Server→client messages that are NOT correlated to an in-flight
 * client request — `notifications/resources/updated` (from `notifyResourceUpdated`) —
 * travel over a single "standalone" SSE stream (the SDK keys it `_GET_stream`).
 * The SDK client opens that stream fire-and-forget when it sends
 * `notifications/initialized` during `connect()`, and the SDK server DROPS any such
 * message sent before the stream is registered — a freshly-opened GET carries no
 * `Last-Event-ID`, so the event store never replays it. A notification triggered in
 * the window between `connect()` resolving and the stream attaching is therefore
 * lost forever: a dropped notification reads as an empty array. The window is
 * invisible on fast local runners but real on slower/contended CI runners
 * (PR #38: Linux, Node 22 and Node "latest").
 * (Request-correlated pushes ride the in-flight request's own stream, which is
 * always attached, so they are unaffected: `ctx.log`, `ctx.reportProgress`, and —
 * since the legacy-HTTP push-routing fix threaded `relatedRequestId` — the
 * `ctx.sample()` / `ctx.elicit()` / `ctx.listRoots()` server→client requests too.
 * The barrier is only needed for the genuinely-uncorrelated notifications above;
 * see tests/server/legacy-http-push-routing.test.ts for the routing proof.)
 *
 * NO-OP for stdio (one pinned bidirectional pipe — the push channel is live the moment
 * `connect()` resolves) and for modern HTTP (stateless; sampling/elicit never cross the
 * wire). FAILS LOUD: if the SDK/FastMCP internals it inspects are ever restructured
 * (no session, or no `_streamMapping` Map) it THROWS naming this function and the probe
 * path, so the next SDK bump gets a signpost instead of a silently-returning flake — it
 * never degrades to the prior raceable behavior. The bounded wait below still just polls.
